**Transpilation**

This project is on Transpilation, It is a term for translating 
code to different formats of the same language. We can use a transpiler to covert our modern code into a 
more compatible version. example of a transpiler for JavaScript is "Babel".
In this project, I practiced configuring Babel to transpile ES6+ code to ES5.
